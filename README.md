#Java Weighted Graph Implementation

This project is a simple, academic implementation of a weighted, directed graph in Java. It uses an adjacency list structure to store the graph, where an array of LinkedLists represents the vertices, and each LinkedList stores the Edge objects for that vertex.

This code was developed as an exercise in understanding basic graph data structures.
